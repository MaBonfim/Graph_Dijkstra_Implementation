# Graph_Dijkstra_Implementation
 Use of the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the minimal distance beetwen 2 vertices in a graph

# How it works
 In short the program consists in short about houses in a city that call for a guard, then calculates which guard is closer then makes a relatory

 The houses are visualized in a graph, the adjacency between vertices is made with "clientes adjacencia.csv"

 example from a shorter file:

 The weights of the edges are calculated with the coordinates of each house in the file "coordenadas_clientes.csv"

 example from a shorter file:

 The result of the relatory contains the house owner, date, time, initial position of the guard, path of the guard and time to arrive the place(sum of the weights)
